# Java Flow Control Practice Code

This repository contains Java programs to practice and demonstrate the use of flow control statements. These programs cover a variety of basic concepts, such as conditional statements and logical operations, to solve real-world problems.

## Overview

This repository includes several small Java programs designed to explore and understand flow control mechanisms. Each program addresses a specific problem and demonstrates the application of `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.
